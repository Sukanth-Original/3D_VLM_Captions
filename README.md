Hereâ€™s a suggested way to structure the headings for GitHub:

# 3D_VLM_Captions

## Overview
A code that generates captions for your 3D model. The process is divided into three phases to ensure a smooth workflow from 3D model processing to caption generation.

## Uncut Video Demonstration
[Watch the demonstration on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Wop6hv2dUaE)

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your 3D Model
- Place your desired 3D model in .STL format inside the **STL_Files** directory.

### Step 2: Run the Script
- Run `main.py` and follow the prompts.

### Step 3: Model Name Input
- When prompted, type the name of the model (e.g., "Panda.STL").

### Step 4: Wait for Phases to Complete
- Wait for **Phase1**, **Phase2**, and **Phase3** to finish processing, which will generate the desired output.

## Code Design

## Phase 1: 3D Model Setup in Blender
- **Initializes the environment in Blender using bpy**
- **Coordinates Calculation**: Determines the X, Y, Z midpoint of the 3D model
- **Scene Initialization**: Clears any previous objects (meshes, lights, cameras)
- **Lighting Setup**: Adds light sources at specific coordinates
- **Camera Setup**: Adds cameras at predefined positions
- **Snapshot Creation**: Captures snapshots from 14 different camera angles and saves them to the specified directory

### Camera and Light Positions
Detailed descriptions for the **Face Cameras**, **Light Sources**, and **Vertex Cameras** used for the snapshots.

## Phase 2: Caption Generation Using VLM
- **VLM Integration**: Uses OpenRouter with Google Gemini 2.0 to generate captions for all 14 images.
- **Flexible Model Choice**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash is used by default, but the model can be swapped as needed.

## Phase 3: Summary Caption Generation
- **Caption Summarization**: Google Gemini 2.0 processes the captions from all 14 snapshots and generates a comprehensive caption summarizing the entire 3D model.

## main.py: Script Flow
- Executes all phases in sequential order: **Phase 1**, **Phase 2**, **Phase 3**.

## config.py: Centralized Directory Management
- Ensures easy communication of directory paths across all three phases to maintain a centralized approach and prevent issues caused by Blender's independent Python environment.

## MIT.env FLAG Usage
- The **FLAG** in **MIT.env** ensures smooth transitions between phases. It ensures that **Phase1** completes before **Phase2** begins, and so on, by tracking when each phase finishes.
